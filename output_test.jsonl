Her best friend isChika, they usually go shopping together and hang around the town.Because of her good nature she has good relationships with her classmates and the rest of the students in the academy. She is one of the few people who wants to make peace with class 2-S. She comes from a poor family, and some of the students in class 2-S bullied her about this, but they were beaten up byKazukoandJun, and immediately stopped the bullying.Despite her actual age, she has the appearance of a elementary school student. Jun has a crush on her (because he's a huge lolicon), and usually treats her gently.[Edited fromMajikoi Wiki]"}
