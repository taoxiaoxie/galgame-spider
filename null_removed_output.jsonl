In reality, she's a girl that his grandmother was already looking after when Kazuhiko was sent to live in the town of Mihoshi.Being a year younger than he, Nanano has always looked up to him as an older brother, and does her part to help around the house by cooking meals and doing housework. As expected,Grandma Hina's death hit Nanano the hardest. In fact, the topic of her death is one of the few things that can bring down Nanano's normally high spirits, and usually leaves her in tears.Nanano's motive is proven to be her desire to become a strong and dependable person. While her intentions are noble, her clumsiness has a tendency to show itself during her efforts, to the point where she'll sleep in without meaning to and occasionally screwing up while cooking. Her cooking is unquestionably good, though, and she manages to keep the house clean all the time.Personality-wise, Nanano is usually cheerful and bright. She's not the smartest person in the world, but can hold her own up to a certain point. People sometimes treat her like a child, which grates on her nerves almost as much as being called \"Nonono\". That being said, she is very gullible and extremely innocent. She also has a tendency to sulk if something doesn't go her way. Nanano is almost always in the company of her trusty sidekick, the turtle known as Kamejirou.[FromMoroboshi Yuumei's review.]"}

Shortly after settling down, she starts playing practical jokes on everyone that crosses her path out of sheer boredom. This does not spare even the store owners in the commercial district. Her quick wit and convincing air of innocence has managed to get her out of trouble, but her true nature quickly becomes apparent to several members of the main cast. Nanano is particularly aware of how cruel some of her pranks can be.<hidden by spoiler settings>Kazuhiko's involvement in Renge's life begins to bring out urges to experience something beyond her usual routine. Her involvement with the other characters exponentially grows when she learns of the local legend of Hoshiuta, and becomes determined to discover the truth behind it when it is revealed that finding the Hoshiuta will grant that person one wish.Personality-wise, Renge is usually serious and arrogant.

Most of what she does involves working off the artwork drawn byKisara, along with other things like helping with the cover box layout as well as the debugging process.Her doujin circle focuses on digital image collections, and it gets a decent number of sales.In contrast to her lively and energetic co-workers, Iori comes off as a cold and stoic person. She'll tend to stick to short answers and doesn't really elaborate on much unless absolutely necessary. She's often silent, and quite expressionless, so it's hard to understand what she's thinking. It's hard to communicate with her too, but the other girls on staff seem to understand what she's getting at, even when she doesn't speak. While she seems to be indifferent to whether Flower closes its doors or not, Iori does care more for the actual people that work with her, and is specially fond of Kisara andNene.Out of the girls at Flower, Iori is the only one who has played an eroge from beginning to end. Even then, she claims to have skipped through most of the dialogue, as her purpose was to study the coloring techniques used in that one game. She has a high level of skill when it comes to coloring characters and backgrounds, but she's no good at all when it comes to tantalizing elements such as flesh and the important liquids in eroge: cum, love juice, sweat, and drool. She is also seen as the most stable of the girls in terms of work performance, as she requires very little input fromTomoyain order to do her part.For some reason she never really reveals, Iori likes putting emphasis on the senses of smell and taste. Unsurprisingly, this is taken to a whole new level once she gets involved with Tomoya.[2 merged summaries - fromMoroboshi Yuumei's reviewand fromMangaGamer]"}

Her work is usually cross-checked with how the scenario writer envisioned the scene before it is passed on to the graphic artist for coloring and cleanup. She is also responsible for the game's cover box artwork. She also publishes her own doujinshi, and her circle's fairly popular.As one of the main players in the creation of a game, Kisara presents herself as a cocky and very confident young woman. She's a strong-willed girl with a lot of pride who's not afraid to say what's on her mind, even when directly criticizing her boss. She grudgily acceptsTomoya'spresence at work, feeling thatNenehiring him was more a waste of resources than anything else. Much to her annoyance, Tomoya is very critical of what she draws, leaving her with a desire to prove herself to him and surpass his expectations.Out of the girls at Flower, Kisara knows the least about eroge, as she has never played one in her life. She has certain ideas about sex, but is forced to use her imagination to fill the gaps, as she is still a virgin. That being said, she is extremely dedicated to her work, as she loves to draw and proves to be willing to give it her all if it'll help make the game better. Her illustration speed varies with her mental state, so while she's fast when on a roll, she's extremely slow when she's feeling down.Also, her characters are cute and the designs fairly attractive, but she has great difficulty with erotic layouts, screen balance, and depicting sexual feelings.To put it bluntly, her art is cute, but not hot.[2 merged summaries - fromMoroboshi Yuumei's reviewand fromMangaGamer]"}
